Hi, I'm back with an intro
to your next assignment. This assignment's a little
bit unusual in format so I wanted to explain a bit about
what we're having you do. But then, the actual instructions are
pretty detailed in the assignment itself. It looks like an ordinary quiz. It has a small set of questions
with some fairly detailed answers. But, you'll discover that the questions
require a pretty extensive amount of thought. We're actually going to encourage
you to take the handout document and look online or
print out the quiz questions first. Work through it before you go into
the system each of these questions is asking you to evaluate
a particular recommender situation. And identify the most appropriate
form of evaluation that would seem to make sense for
the goals of that recommender. This may seem like a strange thing
to do in a multiple choice quiz. In fact, it's going to be graded
in a somewhat unusual way. Everyone of the questions has some answer
that will get complete full credit. But also, some answers that get partial
credit because they are partially right but not the best answer. As you go through it and complete it,
we will give you an opportunity to take a look at some feedback on why
any given answer might be better or worse, and we'll reflect on
these later on in the course. But the idea here is for
you to take everything you know and a set of situations and think about
what the best way to a evaluate a recommender with the idea of being
able to tune it, improve it and figure out how good it is for
particular purpose. Give it a try and
we'll talk more about it later.

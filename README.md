# Recommender Systems Specialization

This repository contains resources for the **Recommender Systems Specialization**, a MOOC that covers key techniques for designing, implementing, and evaluating recommender systems. It includes course subtitles and lab solutions.

### Specialization Overview

This specialization introduces fundamental and advanced recommender system techniques, including non-personalized recommenders, content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and hybrid approaches. Learners will complete interactive exercises and use the LensKit open-source toolkit. The capstone project integrates these concepts into a real-world recommender system design.

### Courses in the Specialization

#### 1. Introduction to Recommender Systems

* Implement and analyze variations of nearest-neighbor techniques.

#### 3. Recommender Systems Evaluation
* Covers prediction accuracy, rank accuracy, diversity, and other metrics.
* Learn offline and online evaluation techniques.

#### 4. Matrix Factorization and Advanced Techniques
* Introduces matrix factorization and hybrid machine learning techniques.
* Covers dimensionality reduction and algorithm combination for improved recommendations.

#### 5. Recommender Systems Capstone
* Apply learned concepts to a full-scale recommender system project.
